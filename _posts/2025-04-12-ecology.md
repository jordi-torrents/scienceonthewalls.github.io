We kicked off our Easter camp by teaming up with our friends at Eco-estilistas for a day all about ecosystems and how to protect them. This started with a street cleaning expedition around the neighborhood, then workshops on clean water systems, photosynthesis, and the importance of invertebrates for healthy soil.
