RSS Discovery boat visit in Alcantara

Exploring the Deep with RRS Discovery! 🌊🔬

We had an incredible visit aboard the RRS Discovery in Lisbon! This remarkable research vessel studies the ocean floor, taking samples from 7,000m below and analysing them in onboard laboratories. We learned about the immense pressures of the deep sea and the vessel’s global expeditions—including Antarctica, where the captain shared stories of breathtaking wildlife. 🐧❄️

We asked all the important questions:
🌊 What happens in a massive storm?
🏴‍☠️ How do they deal with pirates?
🍽️ What do they eat for 9 weeks at sea? (Answer: delicious English food, thanks to their onboard chef!)
We also discovered that if the GPS fails, they can navigate using the stars—a skill as timeless as the ocean itself. ✨🌍

A huge thank you to the National Oceanography Centre, British Council, and the British Embassy Lisbon for making this experience possible! 🙌 We had a fantastic guided tour, met the captain, enjoyed some snacks, and left with amazing keepsakes—stickers, drawings, postcards, and even a water bottle!
